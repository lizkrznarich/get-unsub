                        While the literature on some of these sources remains limited, there's a large and robust body of research and case studies reporting the prevalence of ILL and document delivery requests in  the wake of Big Deal cancellations.

                        Based on this research, we can estimate that ILL/DD will account for about

                        In this scenario, we forecast <strong>{{count | round}}</strong> annual uses will be fulfilled by your  perpetual-access backfile (historical content you've already paid for), even though they can't be fulfilled via Open Access.

                    <p>
                        Backfile fulfillments will trend downward every year after a cancellation, as perpetual access content becomes increasingly stale. For some titles (eg in biomed), readers mostly care about  new content, and so the backfile loses value quickly after cancellation. In others (eg in math), old content stays relevant for a long time, and so the backfile will fulfill a lot of usage for years to come. Our model accounts for this.

                    <p>
                        By default, we assume you've got perpetual access to all purchased content since 2010. You can modify that assumption by uploading custom perpetual access date ranges.
